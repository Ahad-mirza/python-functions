# Solve these problems 😊

### ❓ **Problem 1: Function with Unlimited Arguments**  
**Problem:**  
You need to write a function that accepts **any number** of input arguments.  
💡 **Hint:** In Python, you can use `*args` to handle multiple arguments.

---

### ❓ **Problem 2: Argument Validation Before Execution**  
**Problem:**  
You need a function that validates its input arguments before proceeding with the main logic.  
💡 **Hint:** Use a decorator or inline validation checks with `if` statements to ensure argument validity.

---

### ❓ **Problem 3: Preserving Function Metadata After Wrapping**  
**Problem:**  
You’ve wrapped a function with another (like a decorator) and noticed that the original function's metadata (like its name and docstring) is lost.  
💡 **Hint:** Use `functools.wraps` to preserve the original function's metadata.

---

### ❓ **Problem 4: Passing Variable Arguments to Another Function**  
**Problem:**  
You want to define a wrapper function that accepts variable arguments and passes them unchanged to another function.  
💡 **Hint:** Use `*args` and `**kwargs` in the wrapper to handle arbitrary arguments and keyword arguments.

---

### ❓ **Problem 5: Timing a Function's Execution**  
**Problem:**  
You want to measure the execution time of a function to see how long it takes to run.  
💡 **Hint:** Use the `time` module to capture start and end times, or a decorator for reusable timing logic.
